Everything from this assignment should work. When we encounter a pokemon in the wild, we print its name,
stats, and moves and then wait for the exit character 'e'. When we get in a battle, we print the npc
pokemon names and levels and then we print all of the stats and moves of its first pokemon. The function
that generates the pokemon takes in the map and uses its coordinates to determine the level. I will say 
again, everything from THIS assignment works. There are ways to crash from two assignments ago but you
have to mess with it for a bit.
