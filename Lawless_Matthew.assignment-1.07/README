Everything should work fine. I used two ifstreams, one to get each line from the file, and one
to parse the individual lines with a comma as the delimiter. I used the same approach for everything
one of the files. Just make a corresponding object, read the fields in and then add it to a vector.
Everything should work great. I only parse the english names for type_names.csv.
