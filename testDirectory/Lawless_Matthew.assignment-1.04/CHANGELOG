    Done
    
    I think I have everything working. Just need to prep for submission and then package it up.

    Closer.
    
    I have three things left to do. I need to make it so that when explorers and wanderers hit terrain they can't go in, that they turn in a random direction. Right now they just do a 180. Then I need to add the --numtrainers switch, and then I need to fix the npcs 'eating' the pc, they don't 'eat' each other, only the pc.

    Fixed bug (for now).
    
    Alright....fixed the uninitialized stuff. It sort of works except since I don't have my pc moving, the npcs catch up real fast and 'eat' the pc and then they get lost and go bananas. Need to make sure that they can't eat him, and also make sure to initialize the non pathfinding npcs with previous locations, as these are needed to determine their next move.

    Fixed the last issue
    
    Fixed the last issue by changing the parameters my generateMove function to pointers instead of objects. I've just realized I need to do the same thing with my findShortestPaths method, so will save in case something goes wrong.

    No progress
    
    Cannot fix this segmentation fault. Valgrind says I have an uninitialized pointer, but I think there is something more sinister going on because gdb literally steps over printf("here") and nothing gets printed to standard output. Going to try something big so committing in case this goes wrong.

    Event simulator 'done'
    
    I wrote the event simulator. It doesn't run yet though. I'm getting ready to debug now, not expecting this to take a ton of time but we will see.

    Started 1.04
    
    Moved files to properly named directory.  Created a function to find the next move for any of the npcs. Created a function to spawn in the npcs. Added separate char array for terrain only, for character only, and then will use the one already there for drawing. Pretty much ready to start the discrete event simulator, maybe a few more things to tweak, like updating some initialization methods that haven't been updated since new stuff has been added.

    Prepped for submission.
    
    Cleaned everything up. Reread the spec and realized that PC needed to be on path. Did that. Wrote readme. Just need to append changelog and then package up to submit.

    Dijkstra's working.
    
    Fixed the bug. Wasn't properly decreasing the key value of the nodes of the heap. Now dijkstras completely fills the map with the shortest paths, I just need to tweak it so we don't look at unwalkable terrain for the given npcs, and make it so when we print the map we don't print the unwalkable terrain.

    Have dijkstra's 'running'
    
    Made a lot of progress. Seems to work for large sections of the map but for some reason not all nodes are being visited despite the heap being empty. Large portions of the map remain unreachable. Haven't debugged yet.

    Started assignment 3.
    
    Moved into directory named for assignment 3. Imported Jeremy's heap over. Created a node object to store distance counts. Made new makefile to be able to use Jeremey's heap.

    Fixed bug identified in last commit. Did some testing. Made README for 1.02. Will add to changelog and submit soon.

    Identified bug in building placement subroutine
    
    One of my while loops to find a place to stick the buildings was infinite looping. I haven't actually fixed it yet, but earlier I deleted the entire file on accident and had to revert back to an old version. I lost less than an hour of work but now I'm paranoid and will be committing more frequently.

    1.02 complete
    
    Added all functionality for assignment 1.02 including the following. Added functionality to generatePaths method so that we look at the gates of surrounding maps to pick our gates so that they match. If one of our maps is on the border of the world, we just write over the gate at the end of that generatingPaths method. Used the probability function given in spec to vary the spawn rates of the buildings. Implemented the I/O and commands n, e, s, w, f x y, q. Should be ready to turn in once I add README and update changelog.

    Started 1.02.
    
    Created world object that holds that 401x401 array. Created a populateMap method that can match the gates of neighboring maps (messed with path generation method). Moved some code from main method into their own functions.

    Added README and clean command to makefile. Created tarball and dumped it into testDirectory to check tarball. Switched directory name to 1.02.

    Finished terrain and path generation
    
    Started and finished method to generate the two required paths. Within that method we build the Pokemon centers and Pokemarts. Went back and finished general terrain generation and filling methods. Added all required terrains. Project should technically be complete with this commit.

    Infrastructure for terrain generation
    
    Created the gameboard grid and begun to build the helper methods I will need in order to generate random disjoint rectangles of the grid and fill them. Made makefile.
