To use the switch, type './TerrainGeneration --numtrainers x' where 'x' is an integer. Did things the canonical way for the most part. The code is not pretty, but I think I implemented all of the required functionality. Used the discrete event simulator that was talked about in class. The hikers and rivals seemed to path properly to the pc, the wanderers, pacers, and explorers all work fine. Visually the different biomes have the intended effect on movement speed. I just used letters to represent the trainers, 'h' for hiker and so on.
