I interpret the spec to mean that I can either implement the numbers for movement or I can implement the letters. I chose the numbers (If you wanted me to implement both, I'm sorry, but please don't take off it is a really easy fix, just ugly and a bit tedious). Placeholders were added for entering the pokemart, pokecenter, and for getting into a fight with a trainer. The hikers and rivals stop moving after you best them in a pokemon battle. For the trainer list, we display 20 trainers at a time, and can flip through the list as required. Everything should work fine.
