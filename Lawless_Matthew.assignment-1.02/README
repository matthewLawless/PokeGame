For terrain generation, choose two points to be the corners of the rectangle and then fill the rectangle with whichever character you want this region to correspond to. I tried to be a little more fancy than that in the hopes that it would look nice, but soon realized that I would need a different approach (which I haven't yet implemented). I computed the paths by picking the entrances (say I'm doing N-S path now) x coordinates, then choosing a random y coordinate. From the entrances, we move down (from north) and up (from south) to this y coordinate, then connect two along the y coordinate they both sit at. I believe everything should work, though sometimes, due to randomness, some of the regions may not be there. Jeremy said this was okay.
