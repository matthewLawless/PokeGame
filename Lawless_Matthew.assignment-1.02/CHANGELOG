    Finished terrain and path generation
    
    Started and finished method to generate the two required paths. Within that method we build the Pokemon centers and Pokemarts. Went back and finished general terrain generation and filling methods. Added all required terrains. Project should technically be complete with this commit.

    Infrastructure for terrain generation
    
    Created the gameboard grid and begun to build the helper methods I will need in order to generate random disjoint rectangles of the grid and fill them. Made makefile.
