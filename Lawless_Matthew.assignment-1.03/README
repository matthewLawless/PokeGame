Used Jeremy's heap for the dijkstra. Did it the expected way I think. Created a node class to represent the vertices of the 'graph'. This is the type that we pass into the heap. Iterate through all spots on the map and give them each their own node that contains their terrain cost, current distance (initialized to 4000, which is the intMAX for me), and their coordinates in the 2d array. We make sure to initialize the node at the location of the pc to distance 0, so it goes to the top of the heap. Then just basic dijkstra. The way I did the npcs is pretty ugly, but simple. We just have one npc class, then we have a NPCtoRival, NPCtoHiker, etc. class that inits terrain travel time. Everything should work.
