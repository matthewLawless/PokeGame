    Identified bug in building placement subroutine
    
    One of my while loops to find a place to stick the buildings was infinite looping. I haven't actually fixed it yet, but earlier I deleted the entire file on accident and had to revert back to an old version. I lost less than an hour of work but now I'm paranoid and will be committing more frequently.

    1.02 complete
    
    Added all functionality for assignment 1.02 including the following. Added functionality to generatePaths method so that we look at the gates of surrounding maps to pick our gates so that they match. If one of our maps is on the border of the world, we just write over the gate at the end of that generatingPaths method. Used the probability function given in spec to vary the spawn rates of the buildings. Implemented the I/O and commands n, e, s, w, f x y, q. Should be ready to turn in once I add README and update changelog.

    Started 1.02.
    
    Created world object that holds that 401x401 array. Created a populateMap method that can match the gates of neighboring maps (messed with path generation method). Moved some code from main method into their own functions.

    Finished terrain and path generation
    
    Started and finished method to generate the two required paths. Within that method we build the Pokemon centers and Pokemarts. Went back and finished general terrain generation and filling methods. Added all required terrains. Project should technically be complete with this commit.

    Infrastructure for terrain generation
    
    Created the gameboard grid and begun to build the helper methods I will need in order to generate random disjoint rectangles of the grid and fill them. Made makefile.
